<h2>You haven't changed.</h2>
<p>However old you are, play the game you remember playing most on the playground at school.
<br><br>You haven't changed that much.

<div class="blogpost">
<h2>"Pointless"</h2>
<p>If you can't see the point
<br><br>You're missing it.
<br><br>Do you see my point?
<br><br><br>#pointless</p></div>

<div class="blogpost">
<h2>Reckless behaviour.</h2>
<p id="blogtext">Opening every window of the advent calendar on December 1st is everything that's wrong with the world.

<div class="blogpost">
<h2>Say what you mean.</h2>
<p>We're all let off the hook too often for not keeping our word or saying how we feel.
<br><br><br><br>"I don't mind"
<br><br>"Help yourself to <i>anything</i>"
<br><br>"I'll be there in <i>literally</i> five minutes"
<br><br><br><br>All things I've said and not really meant.
<br><br>"I'm sorry I've been so busy" or "it just wasn't important enough for me to get it done".
<br><br>Doing what you say you're going to do is about more than making plans.
<br><br><br>#keepyourword</p></div>

<div class="blogpost">
<h2>The donkey work.</h2>
<p>"We don't have to do the donkey work, the machine will do that for us".
<br><br>Most people I talk to about work concur the majority of their time isn't spent working. It's spent tidying up, attending meetings, keeping the peace. 
<br><br>The donkey work isn't fun but it's sometimes necessary. Let the smartarse machine do it if it's progress.
<br><br><br>#donkeywork</p></div>

<div class="blogpost">
<h2>110.</h2>
<P>"I'll give 110%."
<br><br>The words every boss wants to hear.<br><br>110 is impossible but even 100 is all in. No room for anything else. No downtime. No balance.
<br><br>You can do a lot with 80 so long as you’re clear it’s not 100. Keep 20 in the tank for finishing early. One more cookie. One less rep. 
<br><br>Instead of being full of shit, why not offer the 50% you're giving.
<br><br><br>#effort</p></div>

<div class="blogpost">
<h2>Generosity.</h2>
<p>Lend somebody you don't know very well a few quid and watch them mess you around.

<h2>High expectations?</h2>
<div>
<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>
<p>...or maybe high expectations are just the key to dissapointment.

<div class="blogpost">
<h2>You don't know.</h2>
<p>You don't know how much you dont know... because you don't know!<br/>
<br><br><br>#ignoranceisbliss</p></div>

<div class="blogpost">
<h2>You're welcome.</h2>
<p>"Thank you for the like on my picture the other day".
<br><br>I'd never thought about it warranting a thanks before but perhaps it does?
<br><br>There's a wonderful irony in my father - a man who has sent postcards all his life - so strongly resisting the connectedness of social media.
<br><br>You're welcome for the like. It's good to be connected.
<br><br><br>#keepintouch</p></div>

<div class="blogpost">
<h2>Bathroom struggles.</h2>
<p id="blogtext">Ten urinals, five sinks, one hand dryer.<br><br>What the fuck.
