<h1>The donkey work.</h1>
<p>"We don't have to do the donkey work, the machine will do that for us".
<br><br>Most people I talk to about work concur that the majority of their time isn't spent working. Instead, it's spent tidying up, attending meetings, keeping the peace. 
<br><br>Don't be afraid of technology "taking over". Donkeys did the literal donkey work for us once upon a time until we made our own version of it with emails and bureaucracy.

<h1>110.</h1>
<P>"I'll give 110%"
<br><br>The words every boss wants to hear.<br><br>110 is impossible but even 100 is all in. No room for anything else. No downtime. No balance.
<br><br>You can do a lot with 80 so long as you’re clear it’s not 100. Keep 20 in the tank for finishing early. One more cookie. One less rep. 
<br><br>Instead of being full of shit, why not offer the 50% you're giving.
